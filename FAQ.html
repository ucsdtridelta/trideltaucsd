  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

  <div class="faqmargin">
    <button class="accordion">Why should I join a sorority?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>There are many beneficial aspects to sorority life that make it a unique and exciting college experience. While different chapters may have different core values, all Panhellenic sororities offer their members the chance to partake in leadership opportunities, philanthropy, scholarship, personal development, and sisterhood. The great thing about joining Greek life is that all of these opportunities are bundled into one organization!</p>
      </div>

    <button class="accordion">What is PHC?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), founded in 1902, is an umbrella organization for 26 (inter)national women’s sororities. The University of California, San Diego has 11 of these 26 sororities on their campus, and they are listed below.</p>
      </div>

    <button class="accordion">How much of a time committment is being in a sorority?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Participating in a sorority is like participating in any co-curricular activity; it requires a time investment. Students in the Panhellenic Community at UCSD have the opportunity for a well-rounded college experience that involves academic work, campus and service involvement, networking, and social events. You choose your level of involvement, but what you get out of being in a sorority is what you put in.</p>
      </div>

    <button class="accordion">Are there academic requirements for joining a sorority?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>In order to go through recruitment, you must be in good academic standing with the university. However, each Panhellenic sorority does choose its own individual scholarly requirements. Panhellenic sororities put a great amount of emphasis on scholarship in addition to other great things they have to offer.</p>
      </div>

    <button class="accordion">What are the financial requirements for joining a sorority?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Joining a sorority does entail a financial commitment, just like other extra-curricular activities. The financial requirements are called dues, and fluctuate in amount according to chapter. The average cost of dues for active chapter members is $330 per quarter, and the average one time fee for joining a chapter is $200. These dues typically cover chapter retreats, recruitment supplies, parent’s weekend events, chapter’s founders’ days, officer training, t-shirts, leadership institutes, formals, and philanthropy events.</p>
      </div>

    <button class="accordion">If I join a sorority, will I still be able to get involved with other organizations on campus?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Absolutely! Chapter members are active all over campus and it is actually highly encouraged that women participate in other organizations. Sisters introduce each other to new organizations on campus all the time, making it even easier to get involved. Chapters have the opportunity to meet and connect with various groups on campus- Multicultural Fraternities and Sororities, Fraternities, athletic clubs and sports teams, Associated Students, as well as various other student organizations. Being a member of the Greek community instantly connects you with numerous students on campus and allows for various ways to get plugged in to campus events.</p>
      </div>

    <button class="accordion">Is there hazing?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>As a member of Panhellenic, Tri Delta does not haze nor does it condone any form of hazing. Tri Delta takes any accusations of hazing very seriously and will conduct a full investigation. We want college to be a fun and exciting experience for all its members!</p>
